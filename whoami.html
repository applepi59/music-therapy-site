    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Zinor Ayanat, and I am a student at Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Chemistry and Biology in Atyrau. This project was born from a very personal and relatable place — I, like many of my classmates, experience high levels of academic stress on a daily basis. I wanted to explore a solution that felt both accessible and meaningful, not just for me, but for others facing the same struggle.</p>

    <p>Music has always been my way to feel safe, grounded, and calm. It inspired me to research whether it could be more than a personal comfort — could it actually be a tool to fight academic stress? My project investigates the effectiveness of music therapy among high school and university students in Kazakhstan, both from a scientific and emotional perspective.</p>

    <h2>Why This Research Matters</h2>
    <p>Through my survey, I found that a majority of students report daily or weekly stress symptoms. The chart below is one of the key responses from my questionnaire, showing just how widespread this problem is among my peers.</p>

    <img src="2a03d1a3-6a70-4b29-a390-3ca08add2307.png" alt="Survey results chart">

    <p>This research is not just academic — it’s personal. It reflects my life and the lives of many others who are looking for non-clinical, creative ways to cope. That is why I believe music, something we already have in our lives, can also become part of the solution.</p>

      “Sometimes I listen to music during study breaks, and it calms my anxiety better than anything else.” — Survey respondent
    </div>

    <p>By combining real data, emotional insight, and a deep love for music, I hope this website and this project can inspire others to turn to music not only for enjoyment, but also for mental balance.</p>
